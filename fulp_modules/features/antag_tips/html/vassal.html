	<p>You are a Vassal, enslaved to your Vampiric Master, you obey their instructions above all else.</p>
	<p>You have the ability tp <i>Recuperate</i>, allowing you to heal at the exchange of your own Blood.</p>
	<p>Fear Mindshields! You will get deconverted if you get mindshielded, resist them at all costs!</p>
